Getting Started
------------
### Update Records
- 2019-1-17: add notification„ÄÅappleMusic etc permission methods.

### 1„ÄÅMost Authorization Access Method
First, import header file:`#import "JLAuthorizationManager.h"`<br>

then,using method:

```
- (void)JL_requestAuthorizationWithAuthorizationType:(JLAuthorizationType)authorizationType
                                   authorizedHandler:(void(^)())authorizedHandler
                                 unAuthorizedHandler:(void(^)())unAuthorizedHandler;
```
`JLAuthorizationType` contains 13 authorization types from 13 libraries, the correspondences as follows:

```
JLAuthorizationTypePhotoLibrary -> Photos/AssetsLibrary <br>
JLAuthorizationTypeNetWork -> CoreTelephony
JLAuthorizationTypeVideo - > AVFoundation
JLAuthorizationTypeAudio - > AVFoundation
JLAuthorizationTypeAddressBook - > AddressBook/Contacts
JLAuthorizationTypeCalendar - > EventKit
JLAuthorizationTypeReminder - > EventKit
JLAuthorizationTypeMapAlways -> CoreLocation
JLAuthorizationTypeMapWhenInUse -> CoreLocation
JLAuthorizationTypeAppleMusic -> MediaPlayer
JLAuthorizationTypeSpeechRecognizer -> Speech
JLAuthorizationTypeSiri -> Intents
JLAuthorizationTypeBluetooth -> CoreBluetooth
```
Implementation method for one example as follows:

```
[[JLAuthorizationManager defaultManager] JL_requestAuthorizationWithAuthorizationType:JLAuthorizationTypePhotoLibrary authorizedHandler:^{
                NSLog(@"PhotoLibrary Has granted!");
            } unAuthorizedHandler:^{
                NSLog(@"PhotoLibrary Has Not granted!");
            }];
```
> **Notes**:Call before use `[JLAuthorizationManager defaultManager]`.

### 2„ÄÅSpecial Authorization Access Method for HealthKit

When you want to use `HealthKit` authorization , please use other method as follows:

```
- (void)JL_requestHealthAuthorizationWithShareTypes:(NSSet*)typesToShare
                                          readTypes:(NSSet*)typesToRead
                                  authorizedHandler:(void(^)())authorizedHandler
                                unAuthorizedHandler:(void(^)())unAuthorizedHandler;
```

Paramrter `typesToShare` need user to pass some healthKit type to share(that is `write` health data to App).

Paramrter `typesToRead` need user to pass some healthKit type to read.

if not clear,please refer to method as follows from [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/reference/healthkit/hkhealthstore/1614152-requestauthorization):

```
- (void)requestAuthorizationToShareTypes:(nullable NSSet<HKSampleType *> *)typesToShare
                               readTypes:(nullable NSSet<HKObjectType *> *)typesToRead
                              completion:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError * _Nullable error))completion;
```

Installation
----
- **For iOS 8+ projects** with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org):

    ```ruby
     pod 'JLAuthorizationManager', '~> 1.1.0'
    ```
    
- **Use Manually**
 
 	```manually
 	git clone 'https://github.com/123sunxiaolin/JLAuthorizationManager.git'
 	
 	then, add JLAuthorizationManager folder into your app
 	
 	in the end, it's all right!
 	```
 	
Requirements
-----
JLAuthorizationManager requires Xcode and iOS version as follows:

- **iOS 8.0 or later**<br>

- **Xcode 8.0 or later**

>**Notes:** if you want to used in xcode 8.0 earlier,please remove methods as follows,if not ,the app can't run at all.

```
- (void)p_requestSpeechRecognizerAccessWithAuthorizedHandler:(void(^)())authorizedHandler
                                         unAuthorizedHandler:(void(^)())unAuthorizedHandlerÔºõ<br>

- (void)p_requestSiriAccessWithAuthorizedHandler:(void(^)())authorizedHandler
                             unAuthorizedHandler:(void(^)())unAuthorizedHandler;
                             
- (void)p_requestAppleMusicAccessWithAuthorizedHandler:(void(^)())authorizedHandler
                                   unAuthorizedHandler:(void(^)())unAuthorizedHandler;                                      
```

Tips and Tricks
---------------

- **Don't** forget add authorization Description in `info.plist`.
- if you want to use `HealthKit` or `Siri`,please open switch on `Capabilities`,then system create `xx..entitlements` file automatically.
- if not find more, please refer to `JLAuthorizationDemo`.
